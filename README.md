cd style-editing  
```  
Edit the config settings (tile location, etc).  
```zsh 
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/data -p 8836:8836 unvt/nanban
cd /data  
npm install  
npm install sqlite3 (note: I cannot understand, but sqlite was not properly installed with the previous command in my case)  
node app.js  
(ctrl + c to stop)
```  
Go http://localhost:8836/index.html to see if the server is running.  

# making a style file (with Docker)
Edit hocon file manually at hocon directory.  

```zsh
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/data -p 8836:8836 unvt/nanban
cd /data
